----
= Install the !LedControl Library =

 # [http://ysm-1288cr3g2c.googlecode.com/files/LedControl.rar Download the Library rar]
 # UnRAR to "*Arduino program folder*"/libraries

I installed the arduino program in the root of my "C" drive so the path I put the library in is:

C:\arduino-1.0.3\libraries\

= Important !LedControl code =

 * *!LedControl lc=!LedControl(10,9,8,2);*
   * Creates a !LedControl to use
   * 10 = pin 10 goes to "!DataIn" of first MAX chip
   *  9 = pin  9 goes to "CLK" of first MAX chip
   *  8 = pin  8 goes to "LOAD" of first MAX chip
   *  2 = number of MAX chips chained together

 * *lc.shutdown(0, false);*
   * The MAX chips always start out in shutdown mode and need to woken up before they can light leds.
   * 0 = address of first MAX chip (1 = second, 2 = third, etc)
   * false = wake up, true = shutdown
   * Can be used in setup() or loop()

 * *lc.setIntensity(0, 8);*
   * Controls the brightness of the LED's
   * 0 = address of first MAX chip
   * 8 = LED brightness (Range: 0 = low, 15 = high)
   * If not called or brightness not specified, it will default to "0", the lowest setting

 * *lc.clearDisplay(0);*
   * Turns off all LED's
   * 0 = address of first MAX chip

 * *lc.setLed(0, x, y, true);*
   * Control one LED
   * 0 = address of MAX chip
   * x = position in the x-axis of the LED to be controlled
   * y = position in the y-axis of the LED to be controlled
   * true = turn LED on, false = turn LED off

 * *lc.setRow(0,1,B11001100)*
   * Specifies what rows should be connected to ground (and in turn, light LEDs)
   * 0 = address of MAX chip
   * 1 = column to apply voltage to
   * B11001100 = most significant bit = row 0, least significant bit = row 7 (1 = connect to ground, 0 = disconnect from ground)

Once you turn an LED on, it will remain on until overwritten or told otherwise. If you turn an LED on, then immediately off, it will seem like the LED never turned on because of the fast scanning.
To properly us an LED
 * lc.setLed(0,0,0,true);
 * delay(500); *insert a delay to let the LED shine before turning it off*
 * lc.setLed(0,0,0,false);

*[Simple code to test all LED's of a 8x8 matrix]*

'If you are using the power from USB, you will see flickering when both red and green turn on to make yellow.'
