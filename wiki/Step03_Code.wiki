----
= Install the !LedControl Library =

 # [ Download the Library .rar]
 # UnRAR to "*Arduino program folder*"/libraries

I installed the arduino program in the root of my "C" drive so the path I put the library in is:

C:\arduino-1.0.3\libraries\

= Important !LedControl code =

 * *!LedControl lc=!LedControl(10,9,8,2);*
   * Creates a !LedControl to use
   * 10 = pin 10 goes to "!DataIn" of first MAX chip
   *  9 = pin  9 goes to "CLK" of first MAX chip
   *  8 = pin  8 goes to "LOAD" of first MAX chip
   *  2 = number of MAX chips chained together

 * *lc.shutdown(0, false);*
   * The MAX chips always start out in shutdown mode and need to woken up before they can light leds.
   * 0 = address of first MAX chip (1 = second, 2 = third, etc)
   * false = wake up, true = shutdown
   * Can be used in setup() or loop()

 * *lc.setIntensity(0, 8);*
   * Controls the brightness of the LED's
   * 0 = address of first MAX chip
   * 8 = LED brightness (Range: 0 = low, 16 = high)
   * If not called or brightness not specified, it will default to "0", the lowest setting

 * *lc.clearDisplay(0);*
   * Turns off all LED's
   * 0 = address of first MAX chip

 * *lc.setLed(0, x, y, true);*
   * Control one LED
   * 0 = address of MAX chip
   * x = position in the x-axis of the LED to be controlled
   * y = position in the y-axis of the LED to be controlled
   * true = turn LED on, false = turn LED off

 * *byte a[5]={B01111110,B10001000,B10001000,B10001000,B01111110};*
   *lc.setRow(0,0,a[0]);*
   *lc.setRow(0,1,a[1]);*
   *lc.setRow(0,2,a[2]);*
   *lc.setRow(0,3,a[3]);*
   *lc.setRow(0,4,a[4]);*
