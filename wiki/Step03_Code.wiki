= Install the !LedControl Library =

= Important !LedControl code =

 * *!LedControl lc=!LedControl(10,9,8,2);*
   * Creates a !LedControl to use
   * 10 = pin 10 goes to "!DataIn" of first MAX chip
   *  9 = pin  9 goes to "CLK" of first MAX chip
   *  8 = pin  8 goes to "LOAD" of first MAX chip
   *  2 = number of MAX chips chained together
