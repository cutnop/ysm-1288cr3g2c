----
= Install the !LedControl Library =

 # [ Download the Library .rar]
 # UnRAR to "*Arduino program folder*"/libraries

I installed the arduino program in the root of my "C" drive so the path I put the library in is:

C:\arduino-1.0.3\libraries\
----
= Important !LedControl code =

 * *!LedControl lc=!LedControl(10,9,8,2);*
   * Creates a !LedControl to use
   * 10 = pin 10 goes to "!DataIn" of first MAX chip
   *  9 = pin  9 goes to "CLK" of first MAX chip
   *  8 = pin  8 goes to "LOAD" of first MAX chip
   *  2 = number of MAX chips chained together
 * *lc.shutdown(0, false);*
   * The MAX chips always start out in shutdown mode and need to woken up before they can light leds.
   * 0 = address of first MAX chip. (1 = second, 2 = third, etc)
   * false = wake up, true = shutdown
   * Can be used in setup() or loop()
