= Install the LedControl Library =

 # [ Download the Library .rar]

I installed the arduino program in the root of my "C" drive so the path I put the library is:

C:\arduino-1.0.3\libraries\

= Important LedControl code =

 * *LedControl lc=LedControl(10,9,8,2);*
   # Creates a LedControl to use
   # 10 = pin 10 goes to "DataIn" of first MAX chip
   #  9 = pin  9 goes to "CLK" of first MAX chip
   #  8 = pin  8 goes to "LOAD" of first MAX chip
