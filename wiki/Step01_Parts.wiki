#summary Where and how to get parts needed to start using a LED matrix
= Arduino =

Duh! Doesn't matter which one, we only need three pins (more on this later).   

= LED Matrix =

The YSM-1288CR3G2C is a dual color LED matrix that you can buy from [https://www.sparkfun.com/search/results?term=LED+Matrix&what=products Sparkfun.com]. They have a small for $5, medium for $7, and a large tri-color for $30.

I used the medium sized matrix and the width of the chip is quite large. As a word of caution, you may need a breadboard with two columns (twice the width of a typical breadboard) to access the pins.

= MAXIM's MAX7219/MAX7221 =

The 7219 and 7221 are basically the same chip, it shouldn't matter which you use. I used the MAX7221 because if you go to this [https://shop.maximintegrated.com/storefront/searchsample.do MAXIM LINK], and search for MAX7221CNG+, you can get free samples of the chip!!!

     note: before you order your free samples, be aware that they wont take personal email accounts when you register. You have to use your school email address to get around this.
*How to order
  # [https://shop.maximintegrated.com/storefront/searchsample.do GO HERE] and search for MAX7221CNG+ 
  # Click the "sample now" link in the right most column
  # Click the "sample cart" directly below the sites search bar in the top right
  # The initial quantity is set to two, but I changed it to four and still got them for free. (I dont know if there is a cap)
  # Tell them roughly how many hours in a year you plan on using the chip(s)
  # Click the "checkout" link
  # From here on, you just fill out your information

= Capacitors =

For every MAX chip you need the following:
 * 10.0 microF capacitor
 * 0.1 microF capacitor (aka 100 nanoF)

= Resistors =
