#summary Where and how to get parts needed to start using a LED matrix

= LED Matrix =

     The YSM-1288CR3G2C is a dual color LED matrix that you can buy from [https://www.sparkfun.com/search/results?term=LED+Matrix&what=products Sparkfun.com]. They have a small for $5, medium for $7, and a large tri-color for $30.

     I used the medium sized matrix and the width of the chip is quite large. As a word of caution, you may need a breadboard with two columns( twice the width of a typical breadboard ) to access the pins.

= MAXIM's MAX7219/MAX7221 =

     The 7219 and 7221 are basically the same chip, it shouldn't matter which you use. I used the MAX7221 because if you go to this [https://shop.maximintegrated.com/storefront/searchsample.do MAXIM LINK], and search for MAX7221CNG+, you can get free sample of the chip!!!

     note: before you order your free samples, be aware that they wont take personal email accounts when you register. You have to use your school email address to get around this.
